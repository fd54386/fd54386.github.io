I am a Semiconductor Product Engineer with a Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering-Physics, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics.  I have experimented with many programming languages such as:
* SQL, JMP, and the JMP Scripting Language (JSL) for day-to-day data analysis
* C# and the Unity engine to develop a 2D game
* VB.net application development to interface with lab equipment
* Assembly Code to interface with PIC microcontrollers for lighting feedback circuits
* Automating daily report e-mails using Python Scripts triggered by Windows Task Scheduler
* Coursework in R, SAS, C++, Java

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, you can find me joyriding around western North Carolina.
